# MicroBlocksCN-Electron
[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆREADME](./README_CN.md)

This is an Electron-based desktop application for MicroBlocks. It wraps the web version of the MicroBlocks IDE (mb-webapp/index.html)(https://github.com/MicroBlocksCN/smallvm) in Electron to provide capabilities for interacting with local hardware, such as Bluetooth and serial port devices.

## Acknowledgements

This project is a continuation of the following open-source projects under the MPL 2.0 license. Thanks to:
*   https://bitbucket.org/john_maloney/smallvm
*   https://github.com/MicroBlocksCN/smallvm

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your system.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, run the following command in the project's root directory to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, execute:

```bash
npm start
```
This command will launch the Electron application.

## Usage Notes

### USB Connection
When using a USB connection, please make sure to plug in your device **before** clicking the 'Connect' button in the application. Otherwise, the device may not be detected.

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Linux
*   When running the AppImage, you may need to add the `--no-sandbox` flag:
    ```bash
    ./MicroBlocks-xxx.AppImage --no-sandbox
    ```
*   To allow the application to access USB devices (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSBx` or `/dev/ttyACMx`), you need to add your user to the `dialout` group. After running the command, you must **log out and log back in** for the changes to take effect:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
    ```

#### macOS
*   If you cannot find Bluetooth devices, you may need to grant the MicroBlocks application Bluetooth permissions in 'System Settings' > 'Privacy & Security' > 'Bluetooth'.

## Building the Application

This project uses `electron-builder` for packaging. You can view and modify the build configuration in the 

package.json

 file.

### General Build

To build a version for the current operating system with the default architecture, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Building for Specific Platforms and Architectures

You can use command-line flags to cross-compile for specific platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and architectures (x64, arm64).

**Windows**

```bash
# Build for Windows x64 (64-bit)
npm run build -- --win --x64

# Build for Windows ARM64
npm run build -- --win --arm64
```

**macOS**

```bash
# Build for macOS Intel (x64)
npm run build -- --mac --x64

# Build for macOS Apple Silicon (arm64)
npm run build -- --mac --arm64
```

**Linux**

```bash
# Build for Linux x64
npm run build -- --linux --x64

# Build for Linux ARM64
npm run build -- --linux --arm64
```

Once the build is complete, the packaged application will be located in the dist folder in the project's root directory.
